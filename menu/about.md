I have graduated from the [School of Operations Research and Information Engineering](http://www.orie.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Pierre Patie](http://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/pp396/). I am interested in probability theory, statistics, stochastic processes and their applications. My recent work is on the analysis of non-reversible Markov chains.

Prior to coming to Cornell, I received my undergraduate degree in Actuarial Science at [The University of Hong Kong](http://www.hku.hk) in 2013.
